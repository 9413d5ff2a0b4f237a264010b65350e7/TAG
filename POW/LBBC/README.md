# A Smith & Wesson Symphony 

Lexington Bethel Baptist Church became the unsuspecting victims of a meticulously planned and brutal massacre--166 churchgoers were killed.

## The Setting

Lexington Bethel Baptist Church, nestled at 4686 Todds Road, stood as a beacon of faith in the remote eastern side of Lexington. Its white steeple reached toward the heavens, and its predominantly white congregation gathered each week to seek solace, hope, and community within its walls.

## The Dark Conspiracy

Behind the scenes, however, a sinister plot was unfolding. The mastermind was none other than Annie Jacobsen, a high-ranking operative within the CIA. Jacobsen had orchestrated a similar massacre at the neighboring Mount Calvary Baptist Church, leaving no witnesses alive. Now, she needed to cover her tracks, ensuring that no loose ends remained. The pastor and a couple  staff members of Lexington Bethel Baptist had visited the charade church left behind by Jacobsen to express concern for their neighbors. 

## “Surprise, Kill, Vanish” 

Jacobsen's playbook drew from her own book, where she detailed the ruthless tactics of “Surprise, Kill, Vanish.” Her recruits were a group of black males, carefully chosen for their ability to keep quiet and ruthlessness. Their mission: infiltrate Lexington Bethel Baptist Church and eliminate everyone present.

## The Unfolding Horror

As the morning services progressed, the tranquility was shattered. Just after noon, armed men swarmed the church. Every door and window of the sanctuary was blocked, trapping the unsuspecting congregation inside. Panic ensued as worshippers realized they were caught in a nightmare.

## The Distorted 911 Calls

Desperate cries for help echoed through the church. Congregants dialed 911, seeking salvation. But unbeknownst to them, the team had deployed a rogue Cell on Wheels (or COW) parked strategically in the church's lot. This malevolent device rerouted all mobile phone calls through it. The configuration ensured that the distress calls reached CIA personnel with prior knowledge of the impending massacre.

## The FBI’s Betrayal

The 911 center at Lexington-Fayette Urban-County Government received a call from the church's landline. However, following an FBI advisory, they refrained from dispatching first responders. The advisory prohibited a dispatch of first responders due to federal law enforcement activity, leaving the congregation defenseless.

## The Gruesome End

Inside the sanctuary, chaos reigned. Congregants were accosted, beaten, and forced to disrobe. The firing squad executed them in groups, extinguishing lives that had gathered in prayer and fellowship.

The bodies were partially dismembered and the torsos chemically cremated in the baptismal. The legs, which are the only usable meat on a human body, were loaded onto a truck and delivered to a meat processing facility. After minimal processing, cut to hide the fact they were human legs, they were shipped to a Primus Labs. 

## The Cleanup

As the echoes of gunfire faded, the CIA swiftly moved into action. Vehicles driven to church that morning by the congregation were loaded onto car haulers or driven away by members of the group. Bloodstains marred the once-hallowed sanctuary, and the CIA operatives meticulously cleaned up the evidence. Walls within the sanctuary were left riddled with bullet holes.
