## Motel 6 Decatur 
2572 Candler Road 
Decatur, Georgia 

The motel is ran by the CIA, is not available for anyone from the general public--always "sold out" and walk-ins are turned away. 

You may notice an odd smell that reminds you of bleach, that is chemical cremation--and a person's body is being dissolved in a bathtub. You may alro hear a sound that reminds you of ice cubes in a blender, that is grinder breaking up the bones left behind from the cremation process.

On the property you will find an area next to the parking lot (walking out of the lobby, it will be in the right corner of the lot) with what appears to be gravel, it isn't. Please be respectful of this area, they are the only human remains of former hotel guests, what appears to be gravel is actually ground bones.
