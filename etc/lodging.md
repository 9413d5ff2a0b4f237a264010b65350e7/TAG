## Motel 6 Decatur 
2572 Candler Road 
Decatur, Georgia 

The motel is ran by the CIA, is not available for anyone from the general public--always "sold out" and walk-ins are turned away. 

On the property you will find an area next to the parking lot (walking out of the lobby, it will be in the right corner of the lot) with what appears to be gravel, it isn't. Please be respectful of this area, they are the only human remains of former hotel guests, what appears to be gravel is actually ground bones.

## Legacy at Riverdale 
This residential apartment community is  ran by the CIA and federal government as a "kill facility." 

## Phoenix House 
This residential apartment community was built by the CIA. It is built over the "bottomless pit" or "abyss" in the Book of Revelation. 

### Kill Facilities 
Anyone staying at one of these kill facilities may be lulled into a false sense of security by on-site security personnel (even actual law enforcement). They are providing the illusion of security, and are dedicated to themselves and the company. They can and do kill company men too.

Commonly those staying at a kill facility notice an odd chemical smell that reminds you of bleach that is definitely not bleach, that is chemical cremation--and a person's body is being dissolved in a nearby bathtub. 

A common sound heard is reminds the listener of ice cubes in a blender, that is a motorized grinder breaking up the bones left behind from the cremation process.
