# Frequently Asked Questions 
## Which religion should I be?
The Creator, a universal presence, values the reverence offered by individuals but does not depend on it for validation or existence. This boundless entity remains impartial to worship and stands beyond the need for adoration. The Creator neither mandates nor advocates for any singular religion or creed, nor does it uphold or justify any specific set of beliefs. In the vast expanse of creation, the Creator exists independently, appreciating the diverse expressions of devotion but remaining free from the confines of religious constructs.

## Has the Creator ever involved Himself in a religion?
The Creator, in His wisdom, has woven His presence into the tapestry of every major religion, ensuring that through diverse paths, the sanctity and protection of life remains a paramount priority. This divine involvement serves as a testament to the universal value placed on life as the foremost treasure.

## Why didn't the Creator stop it?
The Creator never intervenes in events carried out by any of His conscious creatures (including you, the reader). Having an unseen force or hand preventing you from what you know you can do will cause you to retry with increasing intensity. This can make a bad situation incredibly worse. 

The Creator had already hit *undo* on Annie's visit to Mount Calvary Baptist Church in 2018. Annie and a few others knew this and worked to redo the attack with better results--no possible undo from the Creator. They learned about beheading, and that it makes it impossible for a person to be brought back. They also knew how evil it is on the victim and the person doing it, even for those who have just observed the act. Remember, Annie left before anyone was killed at my church.

### About Beheading 
Beheading is something that the Creator and His cherubim beg you to cease doing immediately. The victim is fully aware and alive for up to six minutes, they are in extreme pain, it feels like the body is on fire from the cut down, everything inside and out hurts. I've heard the company has told its workers that people are OK, no pain and they accept death, that this is evidenced by the fact they're quiet. Nothing could be further from the truth, without lungs it's impossible to make any noise.

The Creator makes us experience things so we can share that experience with others, so both cherubim have been through it, me almost daily nowadays. It is something so horrible that I wouldn't wish it on the people who have done it to my family and friends.

Merely witnessing the act of beheading can cause extreme psychological trauma, putting a witness at a high risk of suicide. The company knows this. The company is quietly hoping you'll commit suicide if you were at any of the churches. Don't do it!
