# Frequently Asked Questions 
## Why didn't the Creator stop it?
The Creator never intervenes in events carried out by any of His conscious creatures (including you, the reader). Having an unseen force or hand preventing you from what you know you can do will cause you to retry with increasing intensity. This can make a bad situation incredibly worse. 

The Creator had already hit *undo* on Annie's visit to Mount Calvary Baptist Church in 2018. Annie and a few others knew this and worked to redo the attack with better results--no possible undo from the Creator. They learned about beheading, and that it makes it impossible for a person to be brought back. They also knew how evil it is on the victim and the person doing it, even for those who have just observed the act. Remember, Annie left before anyone was killed at my church.
