The most valuable hotel in the CIA's portfolio is priceless to the CIA and the US federal government is the one named after Patricia Ann Rogers Crawley Williams.

"If the song "Raspberry Beret" by my cousin Prince Rogers Nelson had another couple verses you would have learned what happened after the visit to Old Man Johnson's farm (that was on Johnson Hill Road) by Josie Rogers (from West Sheepneck Road) and Lila Crawley (from Crawley Hill Road)--the birth of my mother the baby girl for both parents who just had a quick horsebarn hookup," says Kelvin Williams.

Both the CIA and the US federal government need this hotel to remain operational so they can divest themselves of the farm most in middle Tennessee knew as Sandy Hook, an unincorporated city in Maury county, that the only living decedent, Kelvin Williams, of the Rogers and Crawley families would inherit according to both family tradition, wills and Tennessee probate law.

What happened in Sandy Hook had to be hidden from the world, so the CIA has been very busy trying to steal everything. The CIA felt it necessary to massacre Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY where Patricia raised her two children and was a longtime member.

Sandy Hook is home to another church connected to Patricia, Orr Chapel, which stood across from her spot on the family farm was destroyed by a developer and the family's cemetery was dug up and pulverized. When the church's members discovered it, the CIA identified them and killed them and others related to them throughout Maury county.
