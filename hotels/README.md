This directory will contain information about CIA Hotels.

Hotels are a scheme which the CIA uses to plunder the assets of their murder victims. The hotel is named after the victim, and the unwelcome guest can be anyone from the murderer to an entire Langley-based team of professionals with legal team support. Some hotels even have resident impersonators.
