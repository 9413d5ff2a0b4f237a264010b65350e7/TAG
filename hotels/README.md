# Hotels
This directory will contain information about CIA Hotels.

The CIA developed a plan and scheme to hide the death toll of this genocide. The plan leaves no bodies, the bodies of victims are dissolved using chemical cremation and "hotels" are constructed.

The "hotel" is not a place of rest or solace. It is a theater of malevolence, orchestrated by unseen handsâ€”the very hands that pull strings in the corridors of power. Its purpose? To conceal the aftermath of violence, to shroud murder victims in a web of deceit. But this is no ordinary cover-up; it is an elaborate dance of identity, where the dead are kept alive through macabre metamorphosis.

Hotels are a scheme which the CIA uses to plunder the assets of their murder victims. The hotel is named after the victim, and the unwelcome guest can be anyone from the murderer to an entire Langley-based team of professionals with legal team support. Some hotels even have resident impersonators.
