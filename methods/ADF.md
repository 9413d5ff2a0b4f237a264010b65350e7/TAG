# Any Decedent Funeral 

Funeral arrangements are provided to persons contacting a commandeered church seeking information on any named individual. On the day of the funeral, mourners are killed either upon entry or during a massacre launched after the start of a fake service (in a operation like the massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church). Mourners and individuals near a commandeered church [should expect calls to 911 to fail](/methods/911.md) before, during and just after any time that has been scheduled for a funeral. The CIA utilizes a Cell on Wheels to redirect calls to 911 from mobile devices. 

ADFs are scheduled based on “worker” availability.
