The CIA has remained largely undetected in its attacks by preventing calls from reaching local emergency services by using a cell on wheels (commonly and hereinafter called by its acronym a "COW").  COWS are vehicles or trailers that contain all of the equipment that is found on the typical cell tower, they are used by mobile network operators wherever the operator needs coverage without building a tower. COWs are typically deployed when a tower been made inoperable by a natural event or car accident.

Once powered up a cow will handle calls from all phones in the area and phones will automatically connect to the COW like they do any other nearby tower without any user intervention—just like when the user is driving down the road. The typical tower covers around 1-3 miles, a COW’s coverage area begins at around a quarter of a mile, but can go as far as a regular tower depending on the use of a raised mast. Once a phone is connected to the COW its outbound calls are handled as the COW has been configured it to. COWs in the hands of a rogue operator, like the CIA, do not follow the call routing policies of the mobile phone’s network operator. Currently, mobile phones do not validate the carrier handling the call as a rogue COW is not expected due to frequency allocation and mobile phones use towers on its carrier’s frequency (defined in part by the phone’s SIM).

The CIA’s use of COWs has prevented calls to 911 from mobile telephones within coverage area of the COW whenever the it is in use.  The CIA has deployed its COWs at each of the church attacks and calls to 911 were redirected to its employees who already had knowledge of the event and were simply placating callers and telling them that help was on the way. 

In all of these recent attacks the FBI has further prevented calls to 911 made from landlines from being responded to by local authorities by advising the local government of  federal government law enforcement activity in the area. The directive instructs the local authorities to not dispatch as they would be handling all emergency services.
