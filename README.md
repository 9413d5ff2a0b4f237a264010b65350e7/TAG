# TAG
The TAG repository the US government cannot have online.

This repository holds both code and non-code assets related to The AIDS cure Genocide started by the Central Intelligence Agency originally on behalf of Gilead Sciences with unwavering support from the executive branch of the US federal government by and through its FBI. 

From the Creator: "TAG stands for The AIDS-cure Genocide, if you think of the childhood game where the number one objective is to not be it, you are halfway there GI Joe, now clone it and share it widely."

## [POW](POW)
Today the way the CIA and government are now playing TAG has changed starting with the [massacre of Mount Calvary Baptist Church in Lexington, KY](POW/MCBC) on a Sunday morning in April 2023. The massacre demonstrated their willingness to make 911 of no use and kill people who were peacefully assembled. 

Additional places of worship have been massacred in an attempt to hide the massacre of Mount Calvary and the CIA has used the properties of these congregations to add to TAG's death toll by announcing funerals and holding various religious services and non-religious events (including super bowl parties and hair shows).

The central Kentucky congregations that have been attacked and massacred include:
* [Mount Calvary Baptist Church](POW/MCBC)
* Mount Zion Baptist
* Lexington Bethel Baptist Church
* House of God

## [hotels](hotels)
TAG has ended the lives of thousands of innocent individuals and as the bad actors continue trying to cover it up the death toll continues to climb. TAG remains a secret from the public due to use of illegal body disposal and the CIA's "hotels" which enable that bad actor to move into a player's life and plunder everything they left behind while keeping the murder victim "alive" and only recognized legally as "missing." Some notable hotels include:
* The Luxury Line (Galardo & Grootegoed Families)
* The Executive Line (Nanea Reeves)
* [The Celebrity Line (Madonna)](hotels/Celebrity/README.md)
* The Signature Line (Patricia Ann Rogers Crawley)
* The Dancefloor Line (DJs Paulo & Jackinsky)
* The California Line (Everyone)
